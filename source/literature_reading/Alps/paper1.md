#### 0. abstract
* _"HV-EA"_: imagined two high velocity anomalies are sepreated by low velocity anomaly benath the TW, indicate a dual source of the velocity heterogenity, most probably formed by a mixture of a fragment of detached European plate and the Adratic slab subduction <___evident for subduction polarity reversal___> 

* _"HV-BM"_: imagined a detached high velocity anomaly benath the BM, three potential scenarios was proposed to  interpretation this anomaly body.
___
#### 1. introduction

1. search for answers on segmentation of the Alps, dip directions of the subductions, their relevance to the European or Adriatic plate, extent of slab delamination, and __particularly to elucidate the smaller size heterogeneity(HV-BM) beneath the Bohemian Massif north of the Eastern Alps subduction__.

2. Proposed three potenial scenarios of the origin of the HV-BM----- a subduction slab or thicked and cold lithosphere.
___
#### 2. result

* __I&II__: "HV-EA": two high velocity anomalies are sepreated by the low velocity body beneath the TW, __I__ of "HV-EA" dips to north, but __II__ seems to immerse southward. ___argue for a mixing of a detached EU slab fragment and the shallow Adria slab connected at depth, may provide a evident to support the idea of subduction polarity reverse___;  

* __III__:"HV-BM":  between ~ 100 and ~ 200km depths, disconnected with shallow part.  

* All pertutbations below ~250km of depth are very weak without any clustering or evident association with stronger hetetogeneities above the level

___
#### 3. resloution test
1. synthetic test
synthetic tests performed the fact that the data used in this paper are able to imagine two separate northward-dipping sub-parrallel slabs beneath the eastern Alps and southern rim of the BM.
2. checkboard tests
___
#### 4. three scenarios of "HV_EA"
1. a remnant of the delaminated European plate

___
#### 5. conclusions
1. __HV-EA__: part __I__ dips to south(adriatic slab), and part __II__ immerse southward, perform an evident to support the hypothesis of subduction polartiy reversal.
2. __HV-BM__: 
    2.1.
